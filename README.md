# BeanTrader - A Card Game Project

## Overview
BeanTrader: A solo-developed C++ card game project for my CSI2772 class (Advanced Programming Concepts With C++), bringing the popular 'Bohnanza' game into the digital realm.
BeanTrader is a card game implementation written in C++. The game involves players trading and collecting different types of beans, creating chains, and strategizing to win the most coins. This project is a digital adaptation of the popular physical card game "Bohnanza."

## Features

- **Player Interaction**: Players take turns drawing and trading cards.
- **Chains and Collections**: Build chains of bean cards to earn coins.
- **Trade Area**: Players can interact with a trade area, adding or trading cards.
- **Save/Load Game**: Supports saving and loading game state.
- **Dynamic Deck**: The game uses a dynamic deck of cards with various bean types.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes OOP principles for code organization.
- **File I/O**: Implements file input/output for saving and loading game state.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mdial145/BeanTrader.git`
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to play and interact with the game.

## Future Improvements

- **Computer Opponent**: Add computer-controlled opponents for single-player mode.
- **GUI Implementation**: Create a graphical user interface for a more immersive experience.
- **Network Multiplayer**: Allow players to connect and play with each other online.
